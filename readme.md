# Work Manager

This is a [Winchester Mystery House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Mystery_House) project: I keep working on it forever because it’s fun, not because I need new features, or even need the app itself.

I like to manage my daily work as a sequence of tasks. I also need to track work for projects, but I don’t need project management. In other words, if I’m going to work on Website Foo, I’ll create a project for “Add X to Website Foo” which includes docs, ticketing systems, the actual work, emails I need to send, etc. A project really just means a single bit of effort. What I don’t want to track is Website Foo as a project in general. It’s never ending, after all.

Oh, and the other thing I want to be able to do is track history. What got done in a given week? That kind of thing. Just for personal tracking. In other words, I don’t want the tasks to disappear into an invisible archive when I’m done.

Anyway, I can do all this in OmniOutliner but thought it might be fun to see if I could get a Mac App going that’s close enough.

- **Initial Idea** (Pre March 6th, 2022)<br/>Make the task manager look kind of like Apple Notes, with projects down the side, and perhaps some interesting filters, like “Available” vs “Completed” or something like that. This kinda works, but it’s too much navigation.

- **Second Idea** (Post March 6th, 2022)<br/>Make the interface a giant flat list of tasks to be done and add filters to the toolbar. “Hide completed”. Show a specific mini-project. That kind of thing. Anyway, that’s what I’m going to do now.

## Winchester Mystery House

Yeah, this:

> Since its construction in 1886, the property and mansion were claimed by many to be haunted by the ghosts of those killed with Winchester rifles. Under Winchester's day-to-day guidance, its "from-the-ground-up" construction proceeded around the clock, by some accounts, without interruption, until her death on September 5, 1922, at which time work immediately ceased. However, Winchester's biographer says that she "routinely dismissed workers for months at a time 'to take such rest as I might'" and that "this flies in the face of claims by today's Mystery House proprietors that work at the ranch was ceaseless for thirty-eight years."

I’m guessing this mode is unfamiliar to most software developers.
